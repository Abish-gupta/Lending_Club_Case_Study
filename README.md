## General Information
- This project explores the key factors contributing to loan defaults at Lending Club.
- The objective is to identify patterns and correlations that can help Lending Club mitigate risks and make informed lending decisions.
- The analysis covers various aspects such as home ownership, loan terms, interest rates, credit grades, and debt-to-income ratios.
- The dataset used includes detailed records of loans, borrower information, and loan performance data.

## Conclusions
- Borrowers with higher loan amounts in the "Other" home ownership category show a higher default rate.
- Approximately 75% of borrowers opted for 60-month loans, with a default rate of around 15%.
- Higher interest rates are significantly correlated with an increased likelihood of loan defaults.
- Lower credit grades (E, F, G) are associated with higher default risks due to elevated interest rates.
- Loans for debt consolidation purposes have a higher incidence of default.
